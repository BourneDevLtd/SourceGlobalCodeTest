# Source Global Code Test - Robert Bourne

To aid in the interview process for Source Global, I have created a custom Drupal 9 module to demonstrate my programming ability. This can be found in `web/modules/custom/employeemanagement`.
This custom module creates a database table called `employees`, inserts employee data on module install, and then selects this data and displays it within a form in the CMS.
The path to view the employees has been set to `/employees`.

Note: I have included the lando (docker) config to run this site locally.

Any questions or queries please contact me - Robertbourne86@gmail.com
